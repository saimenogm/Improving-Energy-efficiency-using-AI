<h2>Improving-Energy-efficiency of Home and Offfice Buildings using-AI</h2>


<h2> Goals </h2>
<ul>
<li>To reduce energy consumption and energy cost</li>
<li>To maximize customer satisfaction</li>
<li>To increase battery life by making optimal charging and discharging ways</li>
<li>Recommend and control best usage time of appliances that optimizes best battery life</li>
<li>Reduce CO2 emmisions and create environmental friendly ecosystem</li>
</ul>


<h2> What will the system do </h2>
<ul>
<li>Price forecasting</li>
<li>Energy consumption forecasting</li>
<li>Energy production forecast (PV generation and weather conditions)</li>
<li>to minimize the peak-to-average ratio while maximizing the OCL of consumers</li>
<li>Mobile App to analyze, monitor and predict your home energy generation and consumption.</li>
</ul>


<h2> Optimization Algorithms </h2>
<ul>
<li>Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to get optimal schedule. PSO is used to pick the best time to use appliance.</li>
<li>Deep learning is used to predict/Forecast energy generated from Solar PV</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning considers the problem of a computational agent learning to make decisions by trial and error. <br/>
We used Deep reinforcement learning is used to maximize its returns (expected sum of rewards). The rewards in this case is supply of optimal energy to user, reduce energy consumption and optimize battery life.</li>
</ul>
